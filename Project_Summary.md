Our data sets consist of economic and pollution data for NJ in 2013. Our Pollution and Economy data was stored in csv's. We were interested in this data because we had an hypothesis that lower income areas are exposed to higher levels of pollution. We also used a currency converter JSON file to allow us to present our economic data to international clients.
